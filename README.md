## Project Structure

### 🧪 `code-gym/`
Mini coding challenges and utility scripts — from BMI calculators to cellular automata.

### 📊 `data-science/`
Projects and notebooks covering:
- NumPy and Pandas training
- Data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization

### 🤖 `machine-learning/`
Classical ML models, including:
- Classification (e.g. diabetes, iris)
- Clustering (e.g. KMeans)
- Pipelines, outlier detection, and regression

### 🧠 `deep-learning/`
End-to-end neural network workflows using TensorFlow and Keras:
- Image classification (Cats vs Dogs, MNIST)
- Medical and structured data models

### 🧬 `llm/`
LLM-based prototype using Gradio + HuggingFace Transformers:
- `llm_chat_phi3.ipynb` – a local chatbot running Phi-3 with timeout handling and optimized inference.

### 🌐 `web/`
Designed as a learning environment for full-stack development and Django + API integration experiments
